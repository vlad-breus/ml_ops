Simple repo for learning ML Ops to run a ML model as microservice using Flask

To do:
- add some simple model (iris / digit classification)
- add an endpoint to return the predictions given the inputs and handle exceptions
- make the API run as a service (use versioning in the paths)
- dockerize the API


Optional to do:
- test the deployment / updates on demo servers
- potentially add various endpoints to test serving image / audio data
